# Machine Learning Code Sandbox
Below are a selection of personal coding projects undertaken for the purpose of skill enhancement and practice in the domains of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of them were performed as capstone projects for the following courses: 
- <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning">Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra</a> from Imperial College London on Coursera

üå± Fellow learners are welcome to use these projects as a base for their own capstone projects.

## 1 - Identifying Special Matrices

### Project description
A Python coding exercise from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning">Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra</a> course. In it, the learner is supposed to create a function that will test if a 4√ó4 matrix is singular, i.e. to determine if an inverse exists, before calculating it.The learner shall use the method of converting a matrix to echelon form, and testing if this fails by leaving zeros that can‚Äôt be removed on the leading diagonal.

## 2 - Gram-Schmidt process

### Project description
A Python coding exercise from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning">Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra</a> course. In it, the learner is supposed to create a function to perform the Gram-Schmidt procedure, which takes a list of vectors and forms an orthonormal basis from this set. As a corollary, the procedure allows us to determine the dimension of the space spanned by the basis vectors, which is equal to or less than the space which the vectors sit. The learner should start by completing a function for 4 basis vectors, before generalising to when an arbitrary number of vectors are given.
